# Strong-field exercises

The repository provides a few simple [Pluto.jl](https://plutojl.org)
notebooks that wrap
[SCID-TDSE](https://github.com/MBI-Theory/scid-tdse) and
[StrongFieldApproximation.jl](https://github.com/jagot/StrongFieldApproximation.jl/tree/master),
mainly for use in the COST/ZCAM school on _New Computational Methods
for Attosecond Molecular processes_ ([2023
edition](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/closed-costzcam-new-computational-methods-for-attosecond-molecular-processes-1242)).

## Usage instructions

```bash
$ export SCID_EXE="path/to/spherical_tdse.x"
$ ./run-pluto.jl
```
